Specifically in areas of project architecture, backend, frontend, and how to effectively self-teach new technologies. I generate technical requirements and determine the most effective solution, create wireframes, design schema, and research outside resources. I also learned how to build and test the back end, incorporate external APIs, create pages/routing, make web requests to retrieve data, format/style the results, and incorporate libraries/themes.
